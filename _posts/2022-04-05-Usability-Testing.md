## Test 1

The first usability test was conducted in the library on the second floor of Tillinghast in a meeting room. The participant was a sophomore and the test was taken during the A period. There was nobody else around except for myself and the patient, which ensured that the patient would not be distracted. I started by handing the patient the home page, where he pressed the Login button. Once on the Login page, the patient seemed confused as to what email and password he had to use. After I told him that he had to use his HM email/password to login into his profile, he entered it in and returned to the Home page. Once back, he decided to access the bus and location page by clicking on it and entering the bus/location page. He said that the map feature didn’t have clear signals as to whether or not he had to click on it to expand it. He did however appreciate the feature that gave him information on his bus number and the location. He also liked the feature that allowed him to open a keyboard to type in his address; this allowed him to find any specific bus. He then pressed the back button and returned to the home page where he then pressed the snack button to go to the snack page. The patient said that the information that told him what the daily snack was very helpful. However, when he looked at the heat map he was confused as to what he was looking at because it had no markings on the map and didn’t have a key that defined everything in the map. 

## Test 2

The second usability test was conducted in the App Development classroom at a desk. Participant S was seated and the conductor of the testing was standing across from S. The participant was a junior in our App Development. One flaw in this test was that it was with a classmate who I am friends with. Additionally, more context could have been provided about the app and tasks. They complemented the arrow and said, "it was useful". S said that they needed an agree button. We guided S to go find their bus and find the weekly snack. When finding the daily snack S clicked on the key for the map first. One issue was when the map expanded this blocked information below it and we had not yet created a back-button/ closeout button. It was also evident that people used the app from top to bottom and read as such. This might have been a reason why S felt "lost and isolated". After we placed an "in progress sign" and then sent user S back to the main page. Features that S felt were helpful were the heat map, list of snacks, and bus number. The main change we should consider is having back buttons that are obvious.

## Test 3

The final usability test went really well since we made some of the minor changes from the previous. It was conducted during a free period with limited distractions for the participant. Starting from the home page of our website again, I told the participant that his task was to find his bus number and check where his bus was parked for dismissal. Automatically, he locked on to the login button and I pulled up the second page with the login. He clicked on the username button and asked me, “What exactly is my username? Is it my horace mann email? Is it my login that I use in first class? This question made me think to myself and we plan to add a small box that says to use your first class login for this username and password. Later on I thought of another idea which was to add a button that lets the app remember the users information so that they never have to login again (this may or may not be necessary for the app). Then the participant clicked the back button and navigated to the bus finder section of our app. Once in this menu, they could see their bus number at the top since they logged in, and they now clicked on the map to find their bus. The map pops up and they were easily able to see where their bus was, and I informed them that the map was not drawn to scale yet. I think the advice from past usability tests helped make this final test way more successful than the previous ones. Some of the confusion from the last ones were resolved and we had a smooth experience.
