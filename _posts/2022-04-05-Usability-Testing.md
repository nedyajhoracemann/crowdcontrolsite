The first usability test was conducted in the library on the second floor of Tilinghast in a meeting room. The patient was a sophomore and the test was taken during A period. There was nobody else around except for myself and the patient, which ensured that the patient would not be distracted. I started by handing the patient the home page, where he pressed the Login button. Once in the Login page, the patient seemed confused as to what email and password he had to use. After I told him that he had to use his HM email/password to login in his profile, he entered it in and returned to the Home page. Once back, he decided to access the bus and location page by clicking on it and entered the bus/location page. He said that the map feature didn’t have clear signals as to whether or not he had to click on it to expand it. He did however appreciate the feature that gave him information on his bus number and the location. He also liked the feature that allowed him to open a keyboard to type in his address; this allowed him to find any specific bus. He then pressed the back button and returned to the home page where he then pressed the snack button to go to the snack page. The patient said that the information that told him what the daily snack was very helpful. However, when he looked at the heat map he was confused as to what he was looking at because it had no markings in the map and didn’t have a key that defined everything in the map. This first test was very helpful because it gave us constructive feedback.
