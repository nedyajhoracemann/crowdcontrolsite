## Digital mockup and testing results

## Problem definition and Proposed solution overview
The HM community struggles to maintain a smooth flowing environment in common areas due to lack of information and distractions. The two most congested places are the bus-dismissal area and the snack location outside of Olshan Lobby. It is difficult to find a specific bus or get a snack. The Crowd Control Committee is devoted to solving this issue and promoting community engagement.

## Contextual Inquiry Results and Key Tasks

Contextual Inquiry #1 - Peer Fly-on-the-wall
Participant A was a student in the community and their task was to leave the library and get snacks. From this we observed many students blocking hallways chatting and snacking as well as no direction in the snack line. It took almost all of a break for Participant A to get their snack because of overcrowding in the line. 

Contextual Inquiry #2 - Faculty Mixed Method Information Collection
Participant B was a non-student during snack. Their role in the HM snack period is significant, as they are the organizer and distributor. Participant B was more engaged with speaking to the CCC and giving their insights on moving the snack from Olshan to Spence. Participant B seemed at ease when handing out snacks because there were less students. 

Contextual Inquiry #3 - Dismissal
Participant X was tasked with going to the buses at the end of the day. Participant x experienced extended wait time and was blocked by different groups of students standing in the middle of the thin road. It improves the crowds and the CCC will continue to take these contextual inquiries into account while looking for solutions in the future.

## Discussion and Implementation Plan

Our final test received similar feedback on major issues/bugs with our new software design. These ranged from minor bug fixes that we had to deal with, involving the layout of the application to the organization and ease of use of the app, to bigger things that the users would have liked to see/ or would expect to see from other objects that they have seen in the world today. We also took into account the accessibility of our design and how someone with some sort of disability would have to use the design every day they came to school. Some of the first ideas that came to mind would be features that catered toward audiences that had problems with sight, hearing, or processing the information on the screen quickly when necessary. These include a voice recognition feature that the user could utilize to say the input information for the software to navigate the different tabs. Another feature would be using a color coding system to help people easily find their bus on the map. Features like these are essential parts of apps to help everyone become users that can confidently accomplish their tasks without dealing with problems along the way. Our prototype has enough to be a beta version for the app but it would need a lot more tweaking to become a fully fledged app. Hearing criticism for our app by new outside users has helped us refine our original ideas for the design and in the future we would try to make each task even easier to accomplish and find out if there were some struggles with our vision of the design.
