## Problem definition and Proposed solution overview

The HM community struggles to maintain a smooth flowing environment in common areas due to lack of information and distractions. The two most congested places are the bus-dismissal area and the snack location outside of Olshan Lobby. It is difficult to find a specific bus or get a snack. The Crowd Control Committee is devoted to solving this issue and promoting community engagement.

## Contextual Inquiry Results and Key Tasks

Contextual Inquiry #1 - Peer Fly-on-the-wall
Participant A was a student in the community and their task was to leave the library and get snacks. From this we observed many students blocking hallways chatting and snacking as well as no direction in the snack line. It took almost all of a break for Participant A to get their snack because of overcrowding in the line. 

Contextual Inquiry #2 - Faculty Mixed Method Information Collection
Participant B was a non-student during snack. Their role in the HM snack period is significant, as they are the organizer and distributor. Participant B was more engaged with speaking to the CCC and giving their insights on moving the snack from Olshan to Spence. Participant B seemed at ease when handing out snacks because there were less students. 

Contextual Inquiry #3 - Dismissal
Participant X was tasked with going to the buses at the end of the day. Participant x experienced extended wait time and was blocked by different groups of students standing in the middle of the thin road. It improves the crowds and the CCC will continue to take these contextual inquiries into account while looking for solutions in the future.

## Usability Testing Process and Results

### Test 1
The first usability test was conducted in the library with a sophmore. They were tasked with finding the daily snack and their bus number on our prototype. The Login page confused the subject because they did not know what email and password they had to use.  We instructed them to use their HM email/password to login into their profile. Then they accessed the bus and location page by clicking it. They noted that they did not realize the map feature needed to be clicked to expand. They appreciated the feature that gave them information on their bus number and the location. Additionally they liked the keyboard feature where they could type their address. Next they went to their next task. They said that the information that told him what the daily snack was very helpful. The Heat map confused the subject and they cited the lack of key as the reason.

### Test 2
The second usability test was conducted in the App Development classroom at a desk. Participant S was seated and the test conductor stood across from S. S is a junior in our App Development. One flaw is our closeness to S. Additionally, more context could have been provided earlier about the app and tasks. S complimented the arrow and said, “it was useful”. S said that they needed an agree button. We guided S to go find their bus and find the weekly snack. When finding the daily snack S clicked on the key for the map first. One issue was when the map expanded this blocked information below it and we had not yet created a back-button/ closeout button. It was also evident that people used the app from top to bottom and read as such. This might have been a reason why S felt “lost and isolated”. After we placed an “in progress sign” and then sent user S back to the main page. Features that S felt were helpful were the heat map, list of snacks, and bus number. The main change we should consider is having back buttons that are obvious.

### Test 3
The final usability test went really well since we made some of the minor changes from the previous. Starting from the home page of our website again, I told the participant that his task was to find his bus number and check where his bus was parked for dismissal. Automatically, he locked on to the login button and I pulled up the second page with the login. He clicked on the username button and asked me, “What exactly is my username? Is it my horace mann email? Is it my login that I use in first class? This question made me think to myself and we plan to add a small box that says to use your first class login for this username and password. Then the participant clicked the back button and navigated to the bus finder section of our app. Once in this menu, they could see their bus number at the top since they logged in, and they now clicked on the map to find their bus. The map pops up and they were easily able to see where their bus was, and I informed them that the map was not drawn to scale yet. I think the advice from past usability tests helped make this final test way more successful than the previous ones.

## Discussion and Implementation Plan

Our final test received similar feedback on major issues/bugs with our new software design. These ranged from minor bug fixes that we had to deal with, involving the layout of the application to the organization and ease of use of the app, to bigger things that the users would have liked to see/ or would expect to see from other objects that they have seen in the world today. We also took into account the accessibility of our design and how someone with some sort of disability would have to use the design every day they came to school. Some of the first ideas that came to mind would be features that catered toward audiences that had problems with sight, hearing, or processing the information on the screen quickly when necessary. These include a voice recognition feature that the user could utilize to say the input information for the software to navigate the different tabs. Another feature would be using a color coding system to help people easily find their bus on the map. Features like these are essential parts of apps to help everyone become users that can confidently accomplish their tasks without dealing with problems along the way. Our prototype has enough to be a beta version for the app but it would need a lot more tweaking to become a fully fledged app. Hearing criticism for our app by new outside users has helped us refine our original ideas for the design and in the future we would try to make each task even easier to accomplish and find out if there were some struggles with our vision of the design.
